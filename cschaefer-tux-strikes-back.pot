"#Tux ran into Nolok's throne room,\n"
"#frantically searching for his beloved.\n"
"#Alas, he found neither Penny nor Nolok\n"
"#there, but instead, another note.\n"

"#drawn in various lands. On the corner\n"
"#of the map was Penny's signature, a\n"
"#drawing of the ice flower.\n"
"\n"
"#Tux ran out of the fortress, map in\n"
"#hand. No, he decided, he would not give\n"
"#up. Penny was counting on him."
